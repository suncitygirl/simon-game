[what is it all about?!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game))

I have implemented it in Vanilla JS with some basic logic and going to do the same with React Redux and styled-components. 
Just because to my mind that's the best way to learn things - doing tiny games (or any kind of entertaining stuff) just for fun.

- [ ] ReactJS (according to my plans, it will be in January'17)
