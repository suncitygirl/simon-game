# Memory skill game.

I have implemented it in Vanilla JS with some basic logic and going to do the same with React Redux and styled-components. 
Just because that's the best way to learn things to my ming - doing tiny things just for fun.

- [x] Vanilla JS
- [ ] ReactJS (according to my plans, it will be in January'17)
